React is a highly productive JavaScript framework and allows the building of complex UIs within a shorter development period. But it is far from the full list of reasons why businesses use React for their applications.

Let’s look into the 13 reasons why use of ReactJS for your project can be a go-to option.

Rich user interfaces
Declarative coding style is one of the key benefits to why use React.js, allowing for building rich user interfaces with less code and time for implementation.

Imagine a button that changes color when clicked. With an imperative style, developers should write code that listens for click events and updates a button state. This can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with more complex UIs.

With React, developers can simply define what the button should do once clicked, while the library takes care of the rest.

Large development community
React is maintained by Facebook engineers, which is a testament to its reliability and why React JS is widespread.

It has an immersive community with over 200K stars and 1600 regular contributors on GitHub.

It has a solid online presence with many active forums and resources where developers can discuss the peculiarities of React use. Some of them include:

Reactflux community
ReactJS community on Reddit 
React community on Hashnode
With such strong community support, developers can solve issues quickly and properly implement trending features.

Offers code stability and flexibility
React makes backward compatibility a priority. This ensures the older React versions are compatible with new ones, and your application will keep functioning effectively with the library’s new releases.

Additionally, React enables modular code — it can be easily modified without affecting other parts of the application.

These features improve the stability of the codebase while making it flexible to changes. This is another reason why React JS is so popular for building web applications.

Write custom components
Custom components are a core part of React architecture. These isolated elements can be assembled to create the final UI. This is one of the most important aspects defining what is React used for in programming.

React developers can use JSX — an extension to JS code supporting HTML to build them. This syntax enables building UI pieces with unique appearances and behaviors. Each component can be separately modified and extended.

This makes React a great tool for building extensible and highly customizable UI to fit specific project needs.

Hassle-free component reusability
Component reusability is another pillar of React. It allows developers to reuse components multiple times anywhere, making it easy to modify existing code and create new functionality.

Developers can also create wrapper components, i.e., “containers,” combining units with similar behavior or styling. It allows reusing bigger UI pieces whenever needed, even across applications.

Reusability of ReactJS components
This helps speed up the development and ensure consistent user experiences across projects and explains why ReactJS is highly efficient for UI development.

Fast rendering
React is optimized for fast rendering. It can update only the necessary parts of a page without re-rendering it entirely. It also supports server-side rendering for faster page loading.

These features improve page loading times, especially for slower network connections.

High performance reinforced by virtual DOM
A big part of high React performance comes with virtual DOM.

The DOM is a tree-like structure representing the webpage. Each time the user interacts with an app, the browser updates the whole DOM “tree.” This process can slow down the application.

React’s virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. So, what does ReactJS do with it? When a user interacts with an app, React updates the virtual DOM and calculates the minimum set of changes to update the actual DOM. It then updates necessary parts of the UI, not all of them.
